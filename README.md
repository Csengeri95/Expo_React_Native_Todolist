This is an Expo-React-native Todo application.The database is provided by MondoDb. The user is able to log in with their own email address or with Apple authentication. It is possible to create tasks in the application, assign a priority to them (depending on this, the application will sort them in advance) and a date, which will be notified to the user when it is completed. The user can edit or delete the task with a swipe. The application uses nested navigation, with a Drawer navigation on the main page, where the user can click on a default profile picture (if no picture was uploaded during registration) in addition to the user name, and upload their own profile picture. This is followed by an animation and the profile picture is placed in a Cloudinary folder. The application uses AsyncStorage, which means that once the user is logged in, the application displays the main page. I created an application icon with Canva.
